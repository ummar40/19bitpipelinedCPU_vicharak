 Choose an 19-bit architecture ( Instruction size will be 19-bit ),Define a specialized instruction set tailored to a specific application or set of applications and Create a detailed architectural specification, including pipeline stages, register file, ALU, and memory interfaces. 
Perform instructions lik:
Arithmetic Instructions(e,g Add the values in registers r2 and r3, and store the result in r1.: peration: r1 = r2 + r3)
Logical Instructions.
Control Flow Instructions.    
Memory Access Instructions.    
Custom Instructions (for specialized applications) like FFT, DEC, ENC etc
